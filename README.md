**Cross-Domain Attribute-Based Access Control Encryption** enables to build an ACE construction from any Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption. 

The structure of this repository is as follows: 
  - Schemes 
    - Ours.py: Python code for the proposed fully constant CD-ABACE scheme in Fig. 2.
    - Testours.py: Python code to run "Ours.py" under a simple example.
    - WC21.py: Python code for Wang and Chow ACE scheme [[1]](#1).
    - TestWC21.py: Python code to run "WC21.py" under a simple example.
    - Waters11.py: Python code for a variation of Waters's CP-ABE scheme [[2]](#2).
    - TestWaters11.py: Python code to run "Waters11.py" under a simple example.
    - PoK.py: Python code for NIZKs used in the construction.
    - ZeroPoly.py: Python code for Zero-Polynomial defines in Def. 3.
